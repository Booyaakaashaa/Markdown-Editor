<h2>Description</h2>

<p>There is one more feature that can be very useful! Imagine going to a grocery store, I bet you would need some kind of a list there. Markdown lists are straightforward; there are two kinds of them: ordered and unordered. I think you've already guessed that the difference between them is that an ordered<em> </em>list itemizes the elements (1., 2., 3., and so on) while an unordered list doesn't do it.</p>

<p>Remember the ordered and unordered list formatters we skipped in the last stage? Let's get back to them!</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Implement the ordered and unordered list formatters. You may want to separate the implementation into two different functions, but I suggest keeping them in one; try to get an idea of how to do it!</p>

<p>Both of the formatters require the following input:</p>

<pre>	<code class="language-no-highlight">- Number of rows: &gt; 3
- Row #1: &gt; First element
- Row #2: &gt; Second element
- Row #3: &gt; Third element</code>
</pre>

<p>Don't forget to check that the number of rows is greater than zero! Otherwise, print the following message: <code class="java">The number of rows should be greater than zero</code> </p>

<p>Don't forget about the formatters that we have implemented in the previous stages.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> <em>the formatters automatically add a line break</em></p>

<pre>	<code class="language-no-highlight">$ python markdown-editor.py
